<h1>ML-StudyCases</h1>
	This is the repository with real life cases used as practice and training while I am learning new features and trying to do new cool stuff.</br>
	Feel free to used any of my templates and welcome...<br></br>

    <li>How projects are organized</li>
 </br>Each Project has its own folder containing all the necessary files to train, validate and test the model. These data could aldo be linked directly inside the notebook.
	Here is a example of the file structure for each project:</br>

 </br>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>environment.yml</strong> → Environment export containing which python libraries/files have been grouped to be used at the Project (possible to import using Python/Conda functions)</li>
  <li><strong>*.csv (data files)</strong> → Data used to train, validate and test the model; sometimes all the files are grouped inside a data folder to get things more organized; if there are diferente files for train, validate and test, the name of the files will be used to determine the type of the data</li>
  <li><strong>*.ipynb</strong> → Python Notebook with all the notes, codes, charts, ...  used during the project</li>
 </ul>
 </ol>
